## How to Contribute

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/issues) and on [Gitlab Issues](https://gitlab.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/-/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- Use the issue templates to create the issue. They include step by step guidelines and have lists of things that should be included.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or updates the documentation?

- Open a new [pull request](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/pulls) on GitHub with the patch. If the patch pertains to the code behind the project, open a new [merge request](https://gitlab.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/-/merge_requests) on Gitlab.
- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Be sure to include a **title**, and as much relevant information as possible. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

- Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of deedown are still accepted! Just follow the same instructions as above.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- **Ensure the feature was not already introduced** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/issues) and on [Gitlab Issues](https://gitlab.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/-/issues). Look for those under the [enhancement](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) tag.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the new feature, [open a new one](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown/issues/new)!
