# deedown
Automatic playlist updater, and deemix track downloader. Can be run as a Windows service to always keep your playlists up to date.

The full code is available here on Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/willtheorangeguy/deedown. 
This repository only contains the scripts to run the Python programs. It assumes that you already have the neccesary prerequisites/code installed/downloaded. 

`1_playlists.cmd` and `3_move.cmd` are run from Command Prompt or PowerShell.
`2_download.sh` needs to be run from a Linux install on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
